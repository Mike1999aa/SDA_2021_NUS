# Smart Data Analytics Class

The repository contains the codes of final projects of the 2021 FE5225 class @ NUS

* Each group should for the following repository and create the folder for their own final project.
* Each project should consist of Quantlets. A Quantlet is a piece of code (a script, or even a bundle of scripts having one main script) responsible for one specific process (e.g. one specific part of analysis: classification step, data preprocessing step etc.). Therefore, your analysis can be divided into a set of steps, where each step is a Quantlet. Your project might have multiple Quantlet folders contained.
* The code of each Quantlet needs to be accompanied by the Metainfo.txt file (it is just a textual configuration file that needs to contain specific info and lies in the same folder as your Quantlet's main script). An example of such file, with the information can be found in the repository's root folder https://github.com/QuantLet/SDA_2021_NUS/blob/main/Metainfo.txt
* This metainfo files are needed to create the README in the LvB style automatically. Please, do not try to create the README by yourself - it will be done automatically.
* The main idea of these Quantlets is that anyone can reproduce your research.



* To have more information on how to create a Quantlet, please refer to the Styleguide of Quantlet:
## [Quantlet Styleguide](https://github.com/QuantLet/Styleguide-and-FAQ/blob/master/guidelines/Styleguide_Guide_GitHub.pdf)


* To upload your code here, please use the following guide:
##[Submission Guideline for non Quantlet Team members](https://github.com/QuantLet/Styleguide-and-FAQ/blob/master/guidelines/Submission_Guide_GitHub_Non_Members.pdf)
In the following guideline please concentrate on submission via pull request (p. 3).
"Fork of the entire repository by a Quantlet Team member" section is not relevant for you since your Quanlet should be a part of the DEDA class repository.
